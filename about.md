Divine Retreat Centre UK (DRC UK) is a branch of the Divine Potta Ministries, originating from Kerala, India. Our purpose is simple: to spread the Good News! Currently, there are two centres in the UK: in Ramsgate, Kent, and Pantasaph, Wales, which are under the direction of the Vincentian Congregation, also hailing from Kerala, India.

Since our inauguration in 2014, hundreds of thousands of people have walked through our doors and experienced the touch of Jesus. These physical doors closed in 2019 as Covid began, but God opened the virtual doors to online ministry and allowed millions to walk through.

As well as our in-person and online services, DRC UK also carries out outreach retreats, social work, fundraising events, and charity work. For more information on our centre, retreats, services, have a look through our ‘About us’ section.

God bless!
